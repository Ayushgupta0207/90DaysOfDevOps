My 90-Day Learning Commitment

1️⃣ What DevOps & Cloud mean to me
DevOps is a way of working where automation, collaboration, and reliability matter more than manual effort. Cloud makes this possible by giving instant infrastructure and scalability. Together, they help teams build and run systems faster, smarter, and with fewer mistakes.

2️⃣ Why I am starting this journey
I want to move beyond routine tasks and understand how real systems are built, deployed, and maintained. I’m learning DevOps and Cloud to automate work, solve practical problems, and build skills that are relevant in today’s IT world.

3️⃣ Where I want to reach in 90 days
By the end of 90 days, I want to be confident with Linux, Git, Python, AWS basics, containers, and CI/CD concepts. More importantly, I want to think and approach problems like a DevOps engineer, not just know tools.

4️⃣ How I will stay consistent
I will spend at least 1–2 hours daily on hands-on learning. Even on busy days, I’ll make sure I do something small. Consistency matters more to me than speed.

5️⃣ My personal commitment
This is not just a course or a checklist. It’s a commitment to show up every day, practice honestly, learn from mistakes, and slowly build real DevOps skills.
